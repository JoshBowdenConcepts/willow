# Contribution

We use [changesets-cli](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage our changelog for this design system. When contributing use the following steps before merging a change.

Run the changeset command:
`npx changeset`

Then when all the changes are made before adding them to your commit run
`npx changeset version`

This will update the changelog and your version in `package.json`.

Now you can push your changes.

Happy Coding!

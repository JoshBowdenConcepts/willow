# Icons

In our design system, icons are built as React components to ensure they are flexible, consistent, and easy to use across applications. Each icon is a standalone, reusable component that supports common props like size, color, and titleAccess for accessibility. By managing icons as React components, we can apply styling, theming, and interaction patterns seamlessly while maintaining a unified visual language. This approach also enables automatic documentation, easy updates, and better integration into our component library workflows.

<div
	style={{
		display: 'grid',
		gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr))',
		gap: '1rem',
		padding: '1rem',
	}}
>
	{Object.entries(IconList).map(([key, Icon]) => (
		<IconItem name={key}>
			<Icon key={key} />
		</IconItem>
	))}
</div>
